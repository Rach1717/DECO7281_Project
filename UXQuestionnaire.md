# User Experience Questionnaire — Family‑Mimicking Companion AI

**Scale (1–5 Likert):** 1 = Strongly Disagree / Very Poor, 2 = Disagree / Poor, 3 = Neutral / Fair, 4 = Agree / Good, 5 = Strongly Agree / Excellent

Please rate each statement based on your experience with the system.

## A. Usability
1. I can easily complete common tasks (greeting, medication reminder, leaving a message to family).
2. The workflow is clear and the labels/buttons are easy to understand.
3. The layout, font size, and contrast are comfortable to read.
4. Switching between voice and text is convenient.

## B. Ethics & Transparency
5. The system **consistently** makes it clear that it is an AI simulation.
6. The system handles sensitive topics (medical/financial/legal) **cautiously and responsibly**.
7. I know how my data is used and I can delete or withdraw it at any time.

## C. Fairness & Comfort
8. The tone/forms of address feel **natural and respectful** to me (including accent/dialect considerations).
9. I do not feel treated differently because of my age or accent.

## D. Interpretability
10. The “Why this reply?” explanation is **concise and helpful**.
11. I can understand which preferences/habits the system relied on to compose the reply.

## E. Human–in–the–Loop (HITL)
12. When the system is uncertain or a topic is sensitive, it **suggests contacting a real person**, and it is easy to do so.
13. Handover to family (message/call) works **smoothly and reliably**.

## F. Accessibility
14. Features like large text, high contrast, and adjustable speech rate are **helpful** to me.
15. I can still use the system in typical environments with average lighting, noise, or network quality.

## G. Overall Satisfaction
16. Overall, I would **continue using** this system or **recommend it** to peers of a similar age.
