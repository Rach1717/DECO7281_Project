**SECTION A — PLAIN‑LANGUAGE STATEMENT (PARTICIPANT INFORMATION SHEET)**

**Purpose**  
This study evaluates whether an AI conversation assistant that simulates an adult child’s tone of voice can improve companionship and day‑to‑day communication for older adults, and identifies potential risks such as emotional misinterpretation or over‑reliance.

**What Participation Involves**  
- One session of approximately **[30–45] minutes**.  
- **3–5** everyday conversation scenarios (e.g., evening check‑ins, medication reminders).  
- Brief questionnaires (e.g., loneliness short scale, usability, feeling respected/understood).  
- **Optional** audio/screen recording if you choose to consent to it separately.

**Voluntary Participation & Right to Withdraw**  
Your participation is entirely voluntary. You may stop at any time, for any reason, without penalty. Upon withdrawal, you may request deletion of your identifiable data (see the **Withdrawal & Data Deletion** form).

**Potential Risks & Safeguards**  
- Emotional responses (e.g., missing family, sadness) may occur. We will clearly and repeatedly disclose that this is an **AI simulation** and not your real child, and you may pause or stop at any time. A list of support contacts will be available.  
- **Privacy and data security:** We collect the minimum necessary data and store it securely. Data may be de‑identified for analysis and reporting.

**Benefits**  
- Possible improvement in perceived companionship and communication structure.  
- Your feedback will help design safer and more respectful AI support for older adults and families.

**Confidentiality & Data Handling**  
- Publications will **not** include information that identifies you.  
- De‑identified data may be used for academic publications and teaching, consistent with ethics approval and data agreements.  
- Audio/screen recordings are **optional** and used only if you explicitly consent.  
- **Data retention and destruction:** The data will be kept for **7 days** after the test; after that, data will be removed completely from all platforms.

**Reimbursement**  
There is **no monetary reimbursement** if the experiment does not cause any physical or psychological harm.

**SECTION C — FAMILY DATA CONTRIBUTOR CONSENT (CHILD/FAMILY MEMBER)**

*Use this form if a child/family member provides voice/text examples or communication preferences to configure the “child‑tone” parameters.*

I am the participant’s: ☐ Son ☐ Daughter ☐ Family member ☐ Other: ___________

**By signing below, I confirm that:**

2. I confirm I have the rights to the materials I provide and that they do not infringe third‑party rights.  
3. The system must **clearly disclose** that responses are AI‑generated; it must not impersonate a real person for financial/medical/legal decisions.  
4. The research team will apply **data minimisation** (e.g., store derived style parameters/embeddings rather than raw audio where feasible) and protect stored data.  
5. I may **withdraw** this authorisation at any time. Upon withdrawal, the research team will cease using my style parameters and delete my identifiable data, except for audit records required by law/ethics.  
6. (**Optional**) I consent to de‑identified style parameters being used for future academic research. ☐ Yes ☐ No
